    <h3>Bay of Bahia</h3>
    <p>Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is cited
       as the most popular getaway for vacationers during peak summer months.
       Popular activities include scuba diving, snorkeling, and bird watching.

  <h3>Selange Beach</h3>
  <p>Selange Beach is known for its temperate sand. Made up of ground coral due
     to thousands of years of tectonic activity, the sand is always cool to the
     touch, despite the heat. The western portion includes fantastic flora and
     fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.</p>

    <h3>Hunt Lagoon</h3>
    <p>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which includes
       swimming through an underground cave), Hunt Lagoon offers a peaceful
       respite from the tourist-laden locations found throughout Kamar. If
       possible, make a visit at night â€“ it's bioluminescent lagoon is like
       viewing fireworks in the !</p>

  <div id="moat">
      <img src="resources/images/moat.jpeg" alt="Moat lagoon">
      <h3>Moat Lagoon</h3>
      <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of the most
         difficult beach locations to access. The lagoon is located inside of a
         prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing it involves
         crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name) with locals
         by kayak. Once there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered)
         quetzal bird and its golden feathers.</p>
